what is the non-php way to do this
<?php include_once __DIR__.'/includes/file.inc.ext'; ?>

is there a clever way to have a string = "https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/microsoft/153/"
and add that to each of the image tags so the URL is shorter and more readable?
reluctant to go straight to URL shorteners as you'll never get the image back if the URL changes
and, don't think I really want to make a copy of every image for the project!
