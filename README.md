# every-single-day

Day 1. Sunday 23rd December 2018.

I don't keep a journal any more. It'd be good to see trends within my moods, motivations and movements so let's make something to track that stuff.

So far, I've got out of bed and designed a few pages in my head. Just visuals for now.
Wanting to explore JS variations, but haven't made any decisions on React yet!


Day 2. Monday 7th January 2019.

Talked with Close and Silcock about JS over Christmas. Going to explore Node + React. I also want to watch some YouTube videos so I know the correct vocab. Re-ordered CSS. Added some tabs within index.html for daily moods & activities. Local MySQL DB not working.
